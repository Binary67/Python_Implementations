# Python Multi Threading
## Introduction
Running several threads is similar to running several different programs concurrently, but with the following benefits âˆ’
1. Multiple threads within a process share the same data space with the main thread and can therefore share information or communicate with each other more easily than if they were separate processes.
2. Threads sometimes called light-weight processes and they do not require much memory overhead; they are cheaper than processes.

A thread has a beginning, an execution sequence, and a conclusion. It has an instruction pointer that keeps track of where within its context it is currently running.
1. It can be pre-empted (interrupted)
2. It can temporarily be put on hold (also known as sleeping) while other threads are running - this is called yielding.

## In this project, I am using Fibonacci numbers to demonstrate python multithreading.
